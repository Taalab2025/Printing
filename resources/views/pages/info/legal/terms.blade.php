                <p>
                    By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms,

                <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
                <p>
                    The Printing Services Marketplace is an online platform that connects customers with printing service providers ("Vendors"). 
                    We facilitate the discovery, communication, and transaction processes between customers and Vendors but are not directly 
                    involved in the production or delivery of printing services.
                </p>

                <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
                <p>
                    When you create an account with us, you must provide information that is accurate, complete, and current at all times. 
                    Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in immediate termination of your account on our Service.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service and for any activities or actions 
                    under your password. You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You must notify us immediately upon 
                    becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.
                </p>

                <h2>4. User Conduct</h2>
                <p>
                    You agree not to use the Service:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In any way that violates any applicable national or international law or regulation.</li>
                    <li>To transmit, or procure the sending of, any advertising or promotional material, including any "junk mail", 
                        "chain letter," "spam," or any other similar solicitation.</li>
                    <li>To impersonate or attempt to impersonate the Company, a Company employee, another user, or any other person or entity.</li>
                    <li>To engage in any other conduct that restricts or inhibits anyone's use or enjoyment of the Service, or which, 
                        as determined by us, may harm the Company or users of the Service or expose them to liability.</li>

                <h2>6. User Content</h2>

                    You represent and warrant that:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You own or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to use and authorize us to use all 
                        intellectual property rights in and to any content that you submit.</li>
                    <li>Your content does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights, or any other

                <p>
                    We reserve the right to remove any content that violates these Terms or that we determine, in our sole discretion, 
                    is unlawful, offensive, threatening, libelous, defamatory, pornographic, obscene, or otherwise objectionable.
                </p>

                <h2>7. Transactions and Payments</h2>
                <p>
                    All transactions between customers and Vendors are facilitated through our platform. By making a purchase, you agree to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provide current, complete, and accurate purchase and account information.</li>
                    <li>Promptly update your account and payment information, including email address, payment method, and payment card 
                        expiration date.</li>
                    <li>Pay all charges at the prices in effect when such charges are incurred.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We use third-party payment processors to facilitate transactions. By using our Service, you agree to be bound by the 
                    terms and conditions of these payment processors.
                </p>

                <h2>8. Vendor Services</h2>
                <p>
                    Vendors are independent contractors and not employees or agents of Printing Services Marketplace. We do not guarantee 
                    the quality, safety, or legality of Vendor services. While we strive to ensure high-quality service from all Vendors, 
                    we are not responsible for the actions or inactions of Vendors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Disputes between customers and Vendors should first be addressed directly between the parties. If a resolution cannot 
                    be reached, our customer support team may assist in mediating the dispute.
                </p>

                <h2>9. Refunds and Cancellations</h2>
                <p>
                    Refund and cancellation policies are set by individual Vendors and may vary. These policies should be clearly stated 
                    on the Vendor's profile or service listing. We encourage customers to review these policies before placing an order.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In general, due to the custom nature of printing services, orders cannot be canceled once production has begun. 
                    However, if a Vendor fails to deliver as promised or if the quality of the delivered product is substantially lower 
                    than advertised, you may be eligible for a refund or reprint.
                </p>

                <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p>
                    In no event shall Printing Services Marketplace, Inc., nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, 
                    or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without 
                    limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service;</li>
                    <li>Any conduct or content of any third party on the Service;</li>
                    <li>Any content obtained from the Service; and</li>
                    <li>Unauthorized access, use or alteration of your transmissions or content.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>11. Disclaimer</h2>

                    we will try to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material 
                    change will be determined at our sole discretion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. 
                    If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Service.
