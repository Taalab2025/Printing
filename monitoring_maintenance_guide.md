# Monitoring and Maintenance Guide for Printing Services Marketplace

This document outlines the procedures and best practices for monitoring and maintaining the Printing Services Marketplace application in a production environment.

## Monitoring Strategy

### System Monitoring

#### Server Health Monitoring

1. **Resource Utilization**
   - CPU usage
   - Memory usage
   - Disk space
   - Network traffic

2. **Server Monitoring Tools**
   - Set up Prometheus and Grafana for comprehensive monitoring
   - Configure New Relic or Datadog for application performance monitoring
   - Use server-level monitoring with tools like Nagios or Zabbix

```bash
# Install Prometheus
wget https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v2.37.0/prometheus-2.37.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar xvfz prometheus-2.37.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
cd prometheus-2.37.0.linux-amd64/
./prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml
```

3. **Alert Configuration**
   - Set up alerts for critical thresholds:
     - CPU usage > 80% for 5 minutes
     - Memory usage > 85% for 5 minutes
     - Disk space < 10% free
     - Server unreachable for > 1 minute

#### Database Monitoring

1. **Performance Metrics**
   - Query execution time
   - Connection pool utilization
   - Slow queries
   - Table size growth

2. **MySQL Monitoring Tools**
   - Enable MySQL slow query log
   - Set up MySQL Exporter for Prometheus
   - Configure MySQL monitoring in Grafana

```sql
-- Enable slow query log
SET GLOBAL slow_query_log = 'ON';
SET GLOBAL slow_query_log_file = '/var/log/mysql/mysql-slow.log';
SET GLOBAL long_query_time = 1;
```

3. **Database Health Checks**
   - Regular backup verification
   - Index optimization
   - Table fragmentation analysis

### Application Monitoring

#### Error Tracking

1. **Error Logging**
   - Configure Laravel's logging to capture all errors
   - Set up log rotation to manage log file sizes

2. **Error Tracking Tools**
   - Implement Sentry or Bugsnag for real-time error tracking
   - Configure error notifications for critical issues

```php
// In config/logging.php
'channels' => [
    'stack' => [
        'driver' => 'stack',
        'channels' => ['single', 'sentry'],
        'ignore_exceptions' => false,
    ],
    'sentry' => [
        'driver' => 'sentry',
    ],
],
```

#### Performance Monitoring

1. **Response Time Tracking**
   - Monitor average and 95th percentile response times
   - Track slow endpoints and database queries

2. **User Experience Metrics**
   - Page load time
   - Time to first byte (TTFB)
   - Time to interactive (TTI)

3. **APM Tools**
   - Configure Laravel Telescope for development monitoring
   - Set up New Relic APM for production monitoring

#### Business Metrics

1. **User Activity**
   - Active users (daily, weekly, monthly)
   - New user registrations
   - User retention rates

2. **Transaction Metrics**
   - Quote requests per day
   - Order conversion rate
   - Average order value
   - Payment success/failure rate

3. **Vendor Performance**
   - Response time to quote requests
   - Order fulfillment time
   - Customer satisfaction ratings

4. **Dashboard Setup**
