# User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Guide for Printing Services Marketplace

This document provides a comprehensive guide for conducting User Acceptance Testing (UAT) for the Printing Services Marketplace application.

## Purpose of UAT

User Acceptance Testing is the final phase of testing where actual users test the application to verify that it meets their business requirements and is ready for production deployment. The primary goals are:

1. Validate that the application meets business requirements
2. Ensure the application is user-friendly and intuitive
3. Identify any issues or bugs from an end-user perspective
4. Confirm that the application is ready for production deployment

## UAT Participants

The following user groups should participate in UAT:

1. **Customers** - End users who will request quotes and place orders
2. **Vendors** - Printing service providers who will manage services and fulfill orders
3. **Administrators** - System administrators who will manage the platform
4. **Stakeholders** - Business owners and decision-makers

## Test Environment Setup

Before beginning UAT, ensure the test environment is properly set up:

1. Deploy the application to a staging environment that mirrors production
2. Populate the database with realistic test data
3. Create test accounts for all user roles
4. Ensure all third-party integrations are configured with test credentials
5. Prepare test payment methods with sandbox accounts
